# ASM For Atlassian

## Status of ASM Maintenance

ASM was originally developed by me to assist in maintaining my personal installations of the Atlassian Suite as well as making my life easier at work.

However, as I am no longer maintaining installs at work, and I am decreasing the amount of technical development I am doing, I no longer have the time to dedicate to the ongoing maintenance of this script.

Therefore as of December 31st, 2015 I am formally pulling support and maintenance for ASM. I will happily maintain the old supporting files on my server, and if anyone wishes to contribute development time, I will more than happily assist.

Unfortunately, as the Atlassian codebase and the means with which they performed installs changed so regularly, it became increasingly difficult to keep up as I was finding every few months that one of the installs would break as a configuration had moved/changed.

I hope this script has served everyone well and am definitely open to handing over the reigns to someone else should they wish to take it up.
Cheers,
Stuart
